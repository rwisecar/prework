#Codecademy Prework Readme

This is a description of the prework I'm going through in preparation for the Code Fellows Python 401 class that begins on Dec 5, 2016. Since my Code 301 class ended in September, I've run through the Python (and Django, where applicable) classes from Codecademy, Treehouse, and Code School. I've worked through *Learn Python the Hard Way* by Zed Shaw, and have started working through *Two Scoops of Django* by Audrey and Daniel Roy Greenfield.
