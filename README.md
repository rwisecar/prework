#Codecademy Prework Readme

This is a description of the prework I'm going through in preparation for the Code Fellows Python 401 class that begins on Dec 5, 2016. Since my Code 301 class ended in September, I've run through the Python (and Django, where applicable) classes from Codecademy, Treehouse, and Code School. I've worked through *Learn Python the Hard Way* by Zed Shaw, and have started working through *Two Scoops of Django* by Audrey and Daniel Roy Greenfield.

There are 5 modules in this Prework Repository, each of which represents the end work product from a Codecademy tutorial: Pyglatin, Supermarket, Teacher, Vacation, and Battleship.

**Pyglatin** is a simple command-line pyglatin translator. It will ask you to enter a word, translate that word into pyglatin, and then ask if you want another word translated.  

**Supermarket** is a simple app that takes in a shopping list, checks to see whether the items are in stock, compiles a total bill and reduces the stock of items purchased accordingly.

**Teacher** is an app that looks at the homework, quiz, and test scores of 3 hardcoded students, calculates each student's average number grade, converts that grade into a letter grade, and then calculates the average number and letter grade for the whole class.

**Vacation** calculates the cost of a vacation to a given city, based on the cost of the flight, hotel, and rental car for a given number of nights, plus any additional spending money.

Finally, **Battleship** is a simple version of the board game. The program hides a battleship on a grid of 0s, and the user gets 5 guesses to find where that ship is on the grid.
